# Unit and Widget Testing with Hello World

This project demonstrates a simple Flutter application displaying the text Hello, World!. It includes examples of unit and widget tests to ensure functionality and UI integrity.

## Steps to Write Effective Tests

### 1. Identify Test Cases

- Understand the behavior and functionality to test.
- For unit tests: Focus on individual methods.
- For widget tests: Focus on UI elements and interactions.

### 2. Set Up Test Environment

- Create test files with _test.dart suffix
- Place in the test/ directory
- Import the necessary packages: import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
- Mock any dependencies if required.

### 3. Write the Test

- Arrange: Set up test data and conditions
- Act: Perform the action being tested
- Assert: Verify the results
- Use group to organize tests logically.
- Write descriptive test names.
- Use matchers like expect to validate outcomes.

### 4. Run the Test

- Use the flutter test command to ensure the tests pass.

### 5. Debug Failing Tests

- Check the failure message.
- Compare expected and actual outcomes.
- Fix issues in the code or the test case as needed.

- HelloWorldWidget contains a Text widget with "Hello, World!" using find.byWidgetPredicate.
- The app bar has the correct title "Hello World App".
- The MaterialApp uses the default theme with no custom theme applied.
- The Scaffold structure includes an app bar and a body of type Center.
- The Text widget with "Hello, World!" has default text style and alignment.
